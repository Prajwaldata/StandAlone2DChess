#Welcome to the Desktop Stand Alone Application of 2D Chess

This is A Stand-alone application which is built in Java and is pretty handy if you want to learn JFrame, GameLoop, Piece Behaviour, and want to understand how our old 19's games worked actually

The src folder contains all the chess-related code you can try to learn. Any mishap you can tag me, and you are free to make some awesome improvements.

Thanks
